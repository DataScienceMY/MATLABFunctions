# MATLABFunctions

### Hi!

- I write MATLAB codes for my study.
- Some of the codes are functions for general purpose that I think might be useful to other people.
- Everyone is welcome to clone and fork the codes in this repo.

Thank you!

### Functions
- heatmapplus.m                 : Create customizable heatmaps
- nicefigure.m                  : Improve the quality of figures, e.g., bigger texts, thicker lines, using latex interpreter etc
- plotpatch.m                   : Shade the background of a plot with a desired color
